## Exposing the app

The server is a **single application** that serves both banking and onboarding domains.

<PartialExample />

:::tip
We recommend pointing both subdomains **to the same application** so that you don't have any sync issues between onboarding and banking.
:::

## Routing

In order to route to the correct client given the domain, the server uses the `x-forwarded-host` or `host` header.

## Content delivery network

In order to avoid stale content or too many hits, we recommended applying a **cache policy** in your app's **HTTP response headers**.
