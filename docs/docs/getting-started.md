**Swan Partner Front-End** is Swan's official client for:
- **onboarding**: the form for an end user to create a Swan account
- **banking**: the banking interface, including transactions, cards, payments & memberships

This project is used internally at Swan to provide the white-label experience.

## How can this be useful for me?

This project can help you:
- **bootstrap** your Swan UI quickly
- **customize** the user experience even further
- **learn** from Swan's own reference implementation
