The Swan Banking Frontend repository, hosted on GitHub, contains two main directories: **clients** and **server**.

## Clients

### Technologies

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): programming language
- [React](https://react.dev/): UI library
- [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/): low-level building blocks
- [Chicane](https://swan-io.github.io/chicane/): routing library
- [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/): GraphQL client
- [Boxed](https://swan-io.github.io/boxed/): functional toolbox

### Structure

In the `./clients` directory, you'll find two frontend clients:

<PartialExample />

#### `public`

The contents of the `public` directory are copied to the root of the application as-is.
This can be useful for favicons, `robots.txt` files, and more.

#### `src`

The application lives in the `src` directory with the following content:

- Entry files
  - `index.html`: HTML entry point
  - `index.tsx`: TypeScript entry point
  - `App.tsx`: root React app component
- Directories
  - `assets`: files you want to import from the TypeScript application
  - `components`: React components
  - `graphql`: GraphQL documents used in the app
  - `locales`: translation files (JSON)
  - `pages`: "root" components for pages
  - `utils`: files used around the codebase

## Server

In the `./server` directory, you'll find the _Backend for Frontend_, sometimes referred to as BFF.

BFF is responsible for:

- Handling OAuth2
- Managing user sessions
- Acting as a proxy for Swan's GraphQL APIs
- Handling some business logic
- Serving the client application

### Technologies

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en): environment
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): programming language
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/): server framework
- [Boxed](https://swan-io.github.io/boxed/): functional toolbox

### Structure

#### `src`

The application lives in the `src` directory with the following content:

- Entry files
  - `index.ts`: server entry point
  - `app.ts`: server main router
  - `env.ts`: environment variables
- Directories
  - `api`: OAuth2 and API-related functions
  - `client`: logic for serving and caching files based on the environment
  - `graphql`: queries and mutations performed by the server
