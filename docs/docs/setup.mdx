# Set up your local environment

:::tip Prerequisites
To use this project, you should have `git`, `node`, and `pnpm` installed on your machine.
:::

## 1. Clone the project

Clone the project using `git`.

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:swan-io/swan-partner-frontend.git
$ cd swan-partner-frontend
```

## 2. Install dependencies

Install [pnpm 9.9.0](https://pnpm.io/installation#installing-a-specific-version), which is required to mangage the monorepository.

```console
$ pnpm install
```

## 3. Set up hosts

We need to be able to replicate the subdomains used in production.
You might need to use `sudo` to edit the `hosts` file.

Add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```txt title="/etc/hosts"
127.0.0.1 banking.swan.local
127.0.0.1 onboarding.swan.local
```

## 4. Set up HTTPS and `mkcert`

In order to replicate the production conditions (primarily for session cookies), the local server runs in HTTPS.
Your system will warn against a self-signed certificate by default, so use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to make your system trust it.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs defaultValue="mac">
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```console
$ brew install mkcert
$ brew install nss # needed for Firefox
$ cd server/keys
$ mkcert -install
$ mkcert "*.swan.local"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
