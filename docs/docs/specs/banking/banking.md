# Web Banking

Use Swan's Web Banking source code to **create your own banking app** for your users.

You can completely customize the **navigation** as well as your **branding**.

Several **pages** are included by default: _History_, _Account_, _Transfer_, _Cards_, _Members_, and _Profile_.
You can keep them all, remove some, or add your ownâ€”whatever you need.

Finally, included are some **workarounds**.
Let Swan know if you need other workarounds, or if you've found one that works well for your use case.

:::info
Swan recommends a 5-minute time-to-live (TTL) for Web Banking, after which the session discontinues automatically.
If the window remains open, the session tokens refresh and the session stays live.
