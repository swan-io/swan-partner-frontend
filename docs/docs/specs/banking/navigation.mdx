# Navigation

The primary navigation for the web banking app consists of four main sections:

1. Partner **logo** and **environment** type.
1. **Account information**, including account name, user name or email address, and balance.
1. **Application pages**, namely _History_, _Account_, _Transfer_, _Cards_, and _Members_.
1. Option to **sign out** and view your own **user profile**.

:::info Permissions-based navigation
The elements displayed depend on the user's account membership and permissions, explained in detail in this documentation.
:::

## Section 1: Logo and environment

![Focused screenshot of section one of the navigation (logo and environment)](./images/nav-section1.png)

## Section 2: Account information

The **account information** section includes (1) the account name and user name, and (2) the account balance.
Alternatively, only the email address might be displayed.

![Focused screenshot of section two of the navigation (account information)](./images/nav-section2.png)

All are retrieved with the API, though visibility is determined by account membership permissions (an _account membership_ is what binds a user to an account).
For any user, query **account memberships** to see which accounts they can access.

**Display the currently-selected account membership**.
When multiple account memberships are available, they should be accessible with a dropdown.

Based on `canViewAccount` permissions, display the following:

| `canViewAccount`                                                                 | Display                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`true`**                                                                       | <ul><li>`membership.account.name` (example: My account)</li><li>`membership.account.holder.name` (example: Matthias Le Brun)</li><li>`account.balance.available`</li></ul> |
| **`false`**<br />(restricts access to the account membership property `account`) | <ul><li>`membership.email` (example: m.lebrun[@]mybrand.com)</li></ul>                                                                                                     |

:::note Account member with no permissions
A user can be an account member **without any permissions**, even the permission to view the account.
This account member won’t be able to access any account information, including the account ID.
:::

### Status tags

The account information section can also be used to share details about the user's `identifications`, `documentCollectionStatus`, and `transactions`.

![Focused screenshot of tag that might be added to account information](./images/nav-section2-tags.png)

We get the last relevant identification (the one matching the `recommendedIdentificationLevel` on the account membership).

| Status                                                                | Explanation                                                                                  | Tag                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **`identification`** is `Pending`                                     | Identification verification is still processing                                              | **Pending**         |
| **`identification`** is _not_ `Valid` or `Pending`                    | Identification verification is at any stage of processing, but not completed                 | **Action Required** |
| **`documentCollectionStatus`** is _not_ `Approved` or `PendingReview` | If **any** account holder has missing or invalid documents (`supportingDocumentCollections`) | **Action Required** |
| **`documentCollectionStatus`** is `PendingReview`                     | If **any** account holder has documents being reviewed (`supportingDocumentCollections`)     | **Pending**         |
| **`transactions`** total is `0`                                       | For `individual` account holders only                                                        | **Action Required** |

## Section 3: Application pages

Pages are visible based on account membership permissions.

| Page         | Rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Section 4: Sign out and profile

Provide a link to **sign out**, plus the **user's information** (avatar and first and last name).

## Visibility and feature flags

Because this project contains the same code Swan uses for all frontend and no-code instances, feature flags are often introduced.
Feature flags make the frontend no-code experience more flexible and have **no impact on the API**.

- `canAddNewMembers`: toggles the **New** button on the Members page
- `canViewMembers`: toggles the Members page
- `canViewAccountDetails`: toggles the Account page
- `canViewAccountStatement`: toggles the “Account statements” button on the History page
- `canOrderVirtualCards`: toggles the “Add card” button on the Cards & Members pages
- `canOrderPhysicalCards`: filters the offered card products on the Cards page
- `canInitiatePaymentsToNewBeneficiaries`: toggles the **New** button on the Transfers page
- `canViewPaymentList`: toggles the Transfers page
- `canManageVirtualIbans`: toggles the **New** button in the Virtual IBANs page

Retrieve information about current feature flags with the API:

```graphql
fragment WebBanking on ProjectInfo {
  webBankingSettings {
    canAddNewMembers
    canViewMembers
    canViewAccountDetails
    canViewAccountStatement
    canOrderVirtualCards
    canOrderPhysicalCards
    canInitiatePaymentsToNewBeneficiaries
    canViewPaymentList
    canManageVirtualIbans
  }
}
```
