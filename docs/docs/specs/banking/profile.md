# Profile

Along with the main navigation, the **user profile** should include the following content:

- User's first and last name
- Email address (connected to account memberships)
- Phone number
- User creation date
- Identification status
- Language preference

Additionally, there should be links to various user resources, whether to your own or to [Swan Customer Support](https://support.swan.io/hc).

:::info Default language
By default, the language matches the `navigation.languages` value of the user's web browser.
If the user overrides this default, the override is stored in the clientâ€™s local storage.
